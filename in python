# union
# union: combines the both sets and create a new set with other two created sets
# union symbol representation "|" or "." we can use any one symbol for union

# intersection: means common values in both sets
# intersection symbol representation "&" or "." we can use any one symbol for intersection

# symmetric difference
# means non-common values in both sets
# symmetric difference symbol representation "^"

# difference
# subtract the values in the set as per code and shows the difference in a selected code
# symbol representation is "-"
